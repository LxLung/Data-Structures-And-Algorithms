# Arrays in general:
# 1. Store elements of the same data type
# 2. Continuous Memory location
# 3. Indexing references elements
# 4. Supports higher dimensions
# List in general:
# 1. Store elements of varying data types
# 2. Dynamic sizing
# 3. Indexing
# 4. Slicing Ex. my_list[0:2]
# 5. Supports common operations: Insertion, Deletion, Sorting, Searching.
# Python default List data type is a List. No surprises here.
my_list = [0, "a string", True]
# If the python numpy module is installed, a numpy array can also be used.
# numpy arrays are not list, but rather Arrays.
import numpy as np
